Iâ€™m a robotics researcher interested in generalizable, data-efficient embodied intelligence via compositional learned models. My keywords are *deep learning*, *generative models*, *trajectory planning*, and *decision-making*.

I'm currently on a gap year, where I'm taking the time to explore my interests at the Recurse Center while applying to PhD programs in CS. I've built:
- A letter-writing site using React and Supabase
- An interpreter for an esolang called Piet using Rust

In the past, I've built:
- A motion primitive sampler using deep imitation learning to accelerate an online long-horizon quadcopter planner. 
- The drone model validation tool at Zipline and root-caused system instability in the a rocket engine at Blue Origin.

I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in June 2024 as a Regents Scholar.
